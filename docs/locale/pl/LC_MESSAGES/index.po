"I'm an enthusiast of **automation** in both my private and professional "
"life. The main reason for that is TIME - one of the most precious thing "
"we have. Contemporary technology let's us design and implement user-"
"friendly solutions that can significantly enhance the way we live or "
"work. At the base of these solutions is DATA - a subsequent treasure that"
" requires appropriate protection. This leads to my other biggest interest"
" - **Information Security** [1]_ which should be a native part of every "
"product at the early stage of its development, and properly maintained "
"throughout its whole life cycle. I have a pleasure to do both working as "
"a **Security Engineer** and **DevOps Engineer** being responsible for "
"maintenance and improvement of **Vulnerability Assessment** [2]_ process "
"through majority of my career."
