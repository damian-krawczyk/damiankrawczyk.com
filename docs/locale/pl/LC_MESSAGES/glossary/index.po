"InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source "
"software and applies them to the way companies develop software "
"internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world "
"class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those "
"practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that "
"companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly "
"closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break "
"down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-"
"boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the "
"open source world."

"A vulnerability /ˌvʌlnərəˈbɪləti/ is a weakness in a system that allows a"
" threat source to compromise its security. It can be a software, "
"hardware, procedural, or human weakness that can be exploited. A "
"vulnerability may be a service running on a server, unpatched "
"applications or operating systems, an unrestricted wireless access point,"
" an open port on a firewall, lax physical security that allows anyone to "
"enter a server room, or unenforced password management on servers and "
"workstations."

"A vulnerability assessment identifies a wide range of vulnerabilities in "
"the environment. This is commonly carried out through a scanning tool. "
"The idea is to identify any vulnerabilities that potentially could be "
"used to compromise the security of our systems. By contrast, in a "
"penetration test, the security professional exploits one or more "
"vulnerabilities to prove to the customer (or your boss) that a hacker can"
" actually gain access to company resources."
