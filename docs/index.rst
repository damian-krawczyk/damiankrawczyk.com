about me
========

I'm an enthusiast of **automation** in both my private and professional life. The main reason for that is TIME - 
one of the most precious thing we have. Contemporary technology let's us design and implement user-friendly 
solutions that can significantly enhance the way we live or work. At the base of these solutions is DATA - a 
subsequent treasure that requires appropriate protection. This leads to my other biggest interest - 
**Information Security** [1]_ which should be a native part of every product at the early stage of its development, 
and properly maintained throughout its whole life cycle. I have a pleasure to do both working as a **Security Engineer**
and **DevOps Engineer** being responsible for maintenance and improvement of **Vulnerability Assessment** [2]_ 
process through majority of my career.

I'm a promoter of open way of working. From coding point of view it means that whenever its' 
possible I'm trying to release my solutions as **Open Source** [3]_
or **Inner Source** [4]_. I hope that the solutions posted here will prove to be handy for you as well.
