    Open Source
        Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, 
        and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by 
        many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with 
        the `Open Source Definition <https://opensource.org/osd>`_.

    Information Security
        Information Security refers to the processes and methodologies which are designed and 
        implemented to protect print, electronic, or any other form of confidential, private 
        and sensitive information or data from unauthorized access, use, misuse, disclosure, 
        destruction, modification, or disruption.

    Inner Source
        InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies 
        them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become 
        accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to 
        bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that 
        companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly closed source 
        software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal 
        collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to 
        contribute software back to the open source world.

    vulnerability
        A vulnerability /ˌvʌlnərəˈbɪləti/ is a weakness in a system that allows a threat source 
        to compromise its security. It can be a software, hardware, procedural, or human 
        weakness that can be exploited. A vulnerability may be a service running on a server, 
        unpatched applications or operating systems, an unrestricted wireless access point, an 
        open port on a firewall, lax physical security that allows anyone to enter a server 
        room, or unenforced password management on servers and workstations.

    Vulnerability Assessment
        A vulnerability assessment identifies a wide range of vulnerabilities in the environment. 
        This is commonly carried out through a scanning tool. The idea is to identify any 
        vulnerabilities that potentially could be used to compromise the security of our systems. 
        By contrast, in a penetration test, the security professional exploits one or more 
        vulnerabilities to prove to the customer (or your boss) that a hacker can actually gain 
        access to company resources.
